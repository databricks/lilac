Post-regal politics dispersed the civil and religious authority of the kings more or less equitably among the patrician elite: kingship was replaced by two annually elected consular offices. In the early Republic, as presumably in the regal era, plebeians were excluded from high religious and civil office, and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge. They resorted to strikes and violence to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office, public priesthood, and knowledge of civil and religious law. The senate appointed Camillus as dictator to handle the emergency; he negotiated a settlement, and sanctified it by the dedication of a temple to Concordia.

It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) between 1998 and 2008 in collaboration with over 10,000 scientists and engineers from over 100 countries, as well as hundreds of universities and laboratories. It lies in a tunnel in circumference, as deep as beneath the FranceSwitzerland border near Geneva, Switzerland. Its first research run took place from 30 March 2010 to 13 February 2013 at an initial energy of 3.5\\xa0teraelectronvolts (TeV) per beam (7\\xa0TeV total), almost 4 times more than the previous world record for a collider, rising to 4 TeV per beam (8 TeV total) from 2012. On 13 February 2013 the LHC\\'s first run officially ended, and it was shut down for planned upgrades. \\'Test\\' collisions restarted in the upgraded collider on 5 April 2015, reaching 6.5 TeV per beam on 20 May 2015 (13 TeV total, the current world record). Its second research run commenced on schedule, on 3 June 2015.  - Prague is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic. It is the 14th largest city in the European Union. It is also the historical capital of Bohemia. Situated in the north-west of the country on the Vltava river, the city is home to about 1.26\\xa0million people, while its larger urban zone is estimated to have a population of nearly 2\\xa0million. The city has a temperate climate, with warm summers and chilly winters.  - Charles University, known also as Charles University in Prague  is the oldest and largest university in the Czech Republic. Founded in 1348, it was the first university in Central Europe. It is one of the oldest universities in Europe in continuous operation and ranks in the upper 1.5 percent of the worlds best universities.  - The Cavendish experiment, performed in 17971798 by British scientist Henry Cavendish, was the first experiment to measure the force of gravity between masses in the laboratory and the first to yield accurate values for the gravitational constant. Because of the unit conventions then in use, the gravitational constant does not appear explicitly in Cavendish\\'s work. Instead, the result was originally expressed as the specific gravity of the Earth, or equivalently the mass of the Earth. His experiment gave the first accurate values for these geophysical constants. The experiment was devised sometime before 1783 by geologist John Michell, who constructed a torsion balance apparatus for it. However, Michell died in 1793 without completing the work. After his death the apparatus passed to Francis John Hyde Wollaston and then to Henry Cavendish, who rebuilt the apparatus but kept close to Michell\\'s original plan. Cavendish then carried out a series of measurements with the equipment and reported his results in the \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\" in 1798.  - Physics (from , from \"phúsis\" \"nature\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.  - The Czech Republic, also known by the short name Czechia, is a nation state in Central Europe bordered by Germany to the west, Austria to the south, Slovakia to the east and Poland to the northeast. The Czech Republic covers an area of with mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate. It is a unitary parliamentary republic, has 10.5\\xa0million inhabitants and the capital and largest city is Prague, with over 1.2\\xa0million residents. The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia.  - Experimental physics is the category of disciplines and sub-disciplines in the field of physics that are concerned with the observation of physical phenomena and experiments. Methods vary from discipline to discipline, from simple experiments and observations, such as the Cavendish experiment, to more complicated ones, such as the Large Hadron Collider.  - Vincenc Strouhal ( enk Strouhal ) ( April 10 , 1850 -- January 26 , 1922 ) was a Czech physicist specializing in experimental physics .

Hint: Another thing we can see in this animation is that particles are constantly colliding with one another. One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light).

      "row= {'__value__': 'â\\x80\\x98A Wanted Man - A Jack Reacher Novelâ\\x80\\x99 by Lee Child - NYTimes.com\\n“A Wanted Man” is Lee Child’s 17th Jack Reacher novel and the last to be published before Reacher goes Hollywood with “Jack Reacher,” a big Christmas movie based on book No. 9, “One Shot,” and starring — can’t say it ain’t so, because it is — Tom Cruise. Mr. Cruise seems such a wrong choice to play this jumbo vigilante that this is a good moment to contemplate the essential Reacher: not just what he looks like but also what he really is.\\n\\nPerhaps in sly response to a movie that will feature a lot of action, Mr. Child begins “A Wanted Man” by confining Reacher to very close quarters. The first 125 pages of this new novel are about a car trip. After waiting exactly 93 minutes on the eastbound ramp of a Nebraska highway, he successfully hitches a ride. The car contains two men and a woman, and Reacher knows nothing about them. Being Reacher, he will spend those first 125 pages observing every detail, watching every move, trying to deduce as much as he can.\\n\\nHis enormous size counts for nothing during this part of the book. Nor does his appearance, although he has a busted nose and is said to resemble a very un-Cruise-like “gorilla with its face smashed in.” And he has no opportunities to resort to his tactic of choice, extreme violence. So he rides along an endless straight road through Iowa thinking about codes and signs and numbers and letters (“Reacher had no patience with people who claimed that y was a vowel”). He is a math guy at heart, and he isn’t likely to meet anyone equally wonky until this series takes him through Silicon Valley.\\n\\nOn the road Reacher gradually figures out that the men, Alan King and Don McQueen, are kidnappers. Their hostage is Karen Delfuenso, a terrified waitress whose car they have hijacked. Reacher arranges to drive the car with Karen in the seat behind him so that they can make eye contact in the rearview mirror. Improbably Karen starts blinking and twisting her head to deliver some kind of secret message. Even more improbably, Reacher cracks her code almost immediately and finds out what she is trying to say.\\n\\nA third of the way into “A Wanted Man,” his only acts of violence have been hypothetical. “It was technically challenging to take out a guy in the front passenger seat while driving at 80 miles an hour,” he muses while at the wheel. Also, the 6-foot-5-inch Reacher has arms so long that he would need to keep his elbow bent: he wants to slug his passenger, not punch out the car’s side window. In any case, it’s time for Mr. Child to get him out of the car and unleash him on the book’s assorted evildoers.\\n\\nOutside the car, meanwhile, “A Wanted Man” has been developing one of the best female characters in the whole Reacher series: Julia Sorenson, an F.B.I. special agent from Omaha who is called in to investigate a potential interstate crime. Once Reacher is sprung from the car, he encounters Sorenson, who ought to be his natural adversary. But she, like all the women who interest Reacher, is as smart and methodical as he is, and he impresses her with his irrefutable, conveniently self-serving logic. He easily convinces her that whatever is unfolding, he and she should be on the same side.\\n\\nReacher’s banter is usually more elegant than it is in “A Wanted Man.” He can do better than this, which he aims at a trucker who is bothering him: “Option 1, get back in your truck and get breakfast 50 miles down the road. Option 2, get in an ambulance and get breakfast through a plastic tube.” Still, the sang-froid of his delivery is what makes the big impression. And anyone worried about Reacher on screen can rest easy. Just remember how dauntingly Mr. Cruise can deliver that kind of dialogue, how greatly the character’s intelligence outshines his brawn, and how formidable Reacher would be even if he didn’t tower over everyone around him. Size doesn’t matter, as you will see in December.\\n\\nSince Mr. Child’s titles tend to be so generic (No. 18 will be “Never Go Back”), “A Wanted Man” is best thought of as the one with the car ride across the Midwest. But it eventually expands into something gigantic: a scheme involving an alphabet soup of federal agencies and the obligatory foreign terrorists operating on American soil.\\n\\nQuick action and solid detective work elevate the second part of this book until it segues into one of the best of the series’s climactic assaults: the expected, wildly over-the-top moment when Reacher must single-handedly penetrate some kind of huge, geometrically interesting, top-secret high-security fortress. This book’s version of that structure is described with clarity. And Reacher, who has been idly showing off his familiarity with Midwestern area codes, soil content and urban population counts, snaps into murderously good form. In this book he seems newly thoughtful about mortality, particularly his own.\\n\\nReacher’s vigilante ethics, à la Dirty Harry’s, are likely to fuel much more controversy in a movie than they do on the page. But these smart, breathless books have no trouble justifying their hero’s acts of vengeance. And “A Wanted Man” is more ingenious than other Reacher books have been about the underground activities Reacher is thwarting. Mr. Child’s endings would be even better if his books’ worst bad guys, besides being swarthy and disposable foreigners, were given tough-guy talents of their own.\\nWhat was this article about?', 'local/physics-auto/gte-small': [{'score': 0.0546446368098259, '__span__': {'start': 0, 'end': 242}}, {'score': 0.03243732452392578, '__span__': {'start': 242, 'end': 323}}, {'score': 0.08543062210083008, '__span__': {'start': 323, 'end': 454}}, {'score': 0.09214544296264648, '__span__': {'start': 454, 'end': 510}}], 'local/physics-auto/gte-small/preview': [{'__span__': {'start': 0, 'end': 242}, 'score': 0.09172439454076356}, {'__span__': {'start': 242, 'end': 323}, 'score': 0.18293827175668687}, {'__span__': {'start': 323, 'end': 454}, 'score': 0.13770001435595217}, {'__span__': {'start': 454, 'end': 510}, 'score': 0.2880310082547189}]}\n",
