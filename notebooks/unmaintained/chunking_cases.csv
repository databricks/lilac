"OpenOrca100k Question, random sampling","A row broke out after Cage described Mohamed Emwazi, known as Islamic State extremist Jihadi John, as an ""extremely kind"" and ""beautiful young man"".
Cage claimed the commission should not have sought to block its funding.
The High Court case judge called for proper discussions in future to avoid wasting taxpayer and charity money.
The case was brought by Cage and the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust.
Cage's research director Asim Qureshi claimed in February that former London student Emwazi - identified as the man in a number of Islamic State beheading videos - had been driven to extremism after UK security services harassed him.
Cage later said it had made ""mistakes"" in its comments about Emwazi, a former client.
The Charity Commission had urged the Joseph Rowntree Trust and the Roddick Foundation not to make any future donations to Cage, which offers support to Muslims suspected of terrorism offences.
Cage and the trust told the High Court the commission had issued a direction it had no power to make, as well as unlawfully fettering the trust's discretion over whether or not to fund Cage should circumstances change.
The commission, which disputed the accusation, said it had been acting within its powers to give advice and seek assurances from the charities that they would not offer future funding to Cage.
The case was settled after a day-long hearing with all sides agreeing that Joseph Rowntree's trustees ""must be free to exercise their powers and duties in the light of circumstances existing at the time"".
And the commission stated it was not seeking to fetter the charity's discretion to fund Cage ""for all time regardless of changing circumstances"".
The case was heard by Lord Thomas - the Lord Chief Justice - and Mr Justice Ouseley.

Typical Porsche 911 models are equipped with engines that produce power output in the range of 379 to 640 horsepower and subsequently provide impressive performance numbers. For instance, the 2022 Porsche 911 Carrera model has a top speed of approximately 182 miles per hour (mph) or 293 kilometers per hour (km/h), while the more powerful 2022 Porsche 911 GT2 RS can reach a top speed of around 211 mph or 340 km/h.

These top speeds and acceleration times make the Porsche 911 one of the quickest cars on the road. However, public roads have speed limits, and it's important to obey traffic laws and prioritize safety while driving.

"OpenOrca100k Response, random sampling","The War of 1812 was a military conflict fought between the United States of America and the British Empire, specifically, the British North American colonies, which later became modern-day Canada. The conflict took place between June 1812 and February 1815, and although it originated due to trade issues and political tensions, it significantly impacted the nations involved, their territories, and the indigenous populations in the region.

The primary parties involved in the War of 1812 include:

1. United States of America: The U.S. was a young and growing nation at the beginning of the 19th century, seeking to assert its sovereignty, protect its international trade rights, and possibly expand its territories. It declared war on Britain because of various grievances, including Britain's attempts to restrict U.S. trade, the impressment of American sailors into the British Royal Navy, and Britain's support of Native American tribes against American expansion.

2. British Empire (Britain and British North American Colonies): Britain was, at that time, engaged in the Napoleonic Wars with France, and its primary concern was its ongoing conflict on the European continent. However, it maintained a presence in North America, especially in the British North American colonies, which later became Canada. The colonies included Upper Canada (now Ontario), Lower Canada (now Quebec), Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, among others. British forces in North America had to defend their territories from the Americans and maintain control over the lucrative fur trade, which required the support of indigenous tribes in the region.

3. Native American Tribes: Several Native American tribes sided with the British during the War of 1812. They did so primarily because they hoped to create a Native American buffer state between the United States and Canada, which would protect their lands from American expansion. Key tribes that fought alongside the British included the Shawnee, led by Tecumseh, the Creek, the Ojibwa, the Ottawa, and the Wyandot. Throughout the war, they engaged in several battles against American forces.

The War of 1812 included various theaters of conflict, such as land battles on the U.S.-Canada border, naval battles on the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean, and military engagements in the American South. Notable battles include the Battle of Queenston Heights, the Burning of Washington, the Battle of Baltimore, the Battle of New Orleans, and the Battle of Lake Erie.

The war concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Ghent in December 1814, which essentially restored the status quo ante bellum (the state of affairs before the war). Neither the British nor the Americans gained or lost significant territories, and many of the issues that led to the war, such as trade restrictions and impressment, were resolved or faded away as the global context changed with the end of the Napoleonic Wars.

In summary, in the War of 1812, the United States of America fought against the British Empire (Britain and its North American colonies, including present-day Canada) and various Native American tribes. The conflict stemmed from unresolved tensions over trade, territorial disputes, and perceived British support for Native American resistance against American expansion.","The War of 1812 was a military conflict fought between the United States of America and the British Empire, specifically, the British North American colonies, which later became modern-day Canada. The conflict took place between June 1812 and February 1815, and although it originated due to trade issues and political tensions, it significantly impacted the nations involved, their territories, and the indigenous populations in the region.",The primary parties involved in the War of 1812 include:,"1. United States of America: The U.S. was a young and growing nation at the beginning of the 19th century, seeking to assert its sovereignty, protect its international trade rights, and possibly expand its territories. It declared war on Britain because of various grievances, including Britain's attempts to restrict U.S. trade, the impressment of American sailors into the British Royal Navy, and Britain's support of Native American tribes against American expansion.","2. British Empire (Britain and British North American Colonies): Britain was, at that time, engaged in the Napoleonic Wars with France, and its primary concern was its ongoing conflict on the European continent. However, it maintained a presence in North America, especially in the British North American colonies, which later became Canada. The colonies included Upper Canada (now Ontario), Lower Canada (now Quebec), Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, among others. British forces in North America had to defend their territories from the Americans and maintain control over the lucrative fur trade, which required the support of indigenous tribes in the region.","3.

Lilac markdown docs,"## Create from Python

Creating a concept can be done in a few lines of code from Python.

First, we need an instance of the [](#DiskConceptDB) which will allow us to create and write a
concept to disk.

```python
import lilac as ll

db = ll.DiskConceptDB()
```

Creating a concept can be done with ""db.create"":

```python
db.create(namespace='test', name='test_concept')
```

Once the concept is created, we can add example data points to the concept:

```python
examples = [
  ll.concepts.ExampleIn(label=False, text='The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'),
  ll.concepts.ExampleIn(label=True, text='This product is amazing!'),
  ll.concepts.ExampleIn(label=True, text='Thank you for your awesome work on this UI.')

Lilac markdown docs,"## Queries

Datasets have two top-level methods for querying:

- [](#Dataset.select_rows): Select individual rows according to searches, filters, sorts, limits,
  and offsets.
- [](#Dataset.select_groups): Select groups and their counts. This is similar to the SQL
  `GROUP BY feature COUNT(*)`. This method gives us a histogram of feature values and their counts,
  with filters applied.

### select_rows

[](#Dataset.select_rows) will return individual rows, applying searches, filters, sorts, and limits.

The result of `select_rows` is a [](#SelectRowsResult), a generator that yields an iterable of
dictionaries for each row. We can also get the result as a Pandas Dataframe by calling
[](#SelectRowsResult.df).

Let's take a look at each parameter to `select_rows`.

August 21, 2023 <br/> _Daniel Smilkov & Nikhil Thorat_

Lilac is an **open-source** tool that enables AI practitioners to see and quantify their datasets.

For an end-to-end example, see our [Quick Start](../getting_started/quickstart.md) guide.

For a detailed documentation, [visit our website](https://lilacml.com/).

<video loop muted autoplay controls src=""https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/2294279/260771834-cb1378f8-92c1-4f2a-9524-ce5ddd8e0c53.mp4""></video>

Lilac allows users to:

- Browse datasets with unstructured data.
- Enrich unstructured fields with structured metadata using
  [Lilac Signals](https://lilacml.com/signals/signals.html), for instance **near-duplicate** and
  **personal information detection**. Structured metadata allows us to compute statistics, find
  problematic slices, and eventually measure _changes_ over time.
- Create and refine **[Lilac Concepts](https://lilacml.com/concepts/concepts.html)** which are
  customizable AI models that can be used to find and score text that matches a concept you may have
  in your mind.
- Download the results of the enrichment for downstream applications.

Out of the box, Lilac comes with a set of generally useful **Signals** and **Concepts**, however
this list is not exhaustive and we will continue to work with the OSS community to continue to add
more useful enrichments.","# Introducing Lilac
