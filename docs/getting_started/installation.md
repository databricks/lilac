# Installation

Lilac is published on pip under [lilac](https://pypi.org/project/lilac/). You can install it with:

```bash
pip install lilac[all]
```

```{note}
To skip optional dependencies, run `pip install lilac` instead. You will have to manually install any
dependencies. For example to install GTE embedding, do `pip install lilac[gte]`.
```

To make sure the installation works, start a new lilac project:

```{note}
If this is a fresh virtual env, it might take a dozen seconds to see the initial output.
```

```bash
‚ùØ lilac start ~/my_project
Lilac will create a project in `/Users/me/my-project`. Do you want to continue? (y/n): y
