# Edit a dataset

```{note}
This page goes into the technical details of editing a dataset in Lilac.
For a real world example, see the blog post on [](../blog/curate-coding-dataset.md).
```

Once you bring the data into Lilac, you can start editing it. The main edit operation is creating a
new column via [`Dataset.map`](#Dataset.map), which takes API inspiration from
[HuggingFace's Dataset.map()](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/process#map). The function being
mapped runs against every row in a table, enhancing that data with new information. For example, we
can call GPT to extract structure from a piece of text, or rewrite a piece of text in a different
style or language.

The benefits of using Lilac's `map` include the ability to track lineage information for every
computed column, and the ability to resume computation if the processing fails mid-way. We are also
working on the ability to write to an existing column, undo and redo edits, and see a history of all
the edits made.

## `Dataset.map`

[`Dataset.map`](#Dataset.map) is the main vehicle for processing data in Lilac.

- It is fundamentally a row-oriented operation. As a text-oriented tool, Lilac assumes that text
  processing (via LLMs, etc.) is more expensive than memory access. It is not like pandas, which
  optimizes for vectorized numerical computation over rows, columns, or entire dataframes.
- Lilac will save your map progress: if the map fails mid-way (e.g. with an exception, or your
  computer dies), you can resume computation without losing any intermediate results. This is
  important when the `map` function is expensive or slow (e.g. calling GPT to edit data, or calling
  an expensive embedding model).
- `map` operates seamlessly over repeated subfields: your map only ever sees a flattened stream of
  items and Lilac keeps track of the association between each item and its source row.
- The output of Lilac's `map` is always written to a new column in the same dataset. We're working
  on versioned columns, which will allow you to overwrite the same column while being able to
  compare/undo the change.
- While the computation is running, the Lilac UI will show a progress bar. When it completes, the UI
  will auto-refresh and we can use the new column (see statistics, filter by values, etc).

### Example usage

Let's start with a simple example where we add a `Q: ` prefix to each `question` in the dataset. By
default, Lilac reads the entire row and your map function will receive the row as a dictionary.

```python
import lilac as ll

items = [{'question': 'A'}, {'question': 'B'}, {'question': 'C'}]
dataset = ll.from_dicts('local', 'questions', items)

def add_prefix(item):
  return 'Q: ' + item['question']

dataset.map(add_prefix, output_path='question_prefixed')
dataset.to_pandas()
```

```
  question question_prefixed
0        A              Q: A
1        B              Q: B
2        C              Q: C
```

### `input_path`

If we want to `map` over a single field, we can provide `input_path`. Let's tell Lilac to only read
the `question` field. The map will no longer see the entire row, but just a single value from the
field we care about:

```python
def add_prefix(question):
  return 'Q: ' + question

dataset.map(add_prefix, input_path='question', output_path='question_prefixed2')
dataset.to_pandas()
```

```
  question question_prefixed question_prefixed2
0        A              Q: A               Q: A
1        B              Q: B               Q: B
2        C              Q: C               Q: C
```

`input_path` is very useful for:

- keeping the `map` code reusable, by decoupling the processing logic from the input schema.
- transforming repeated fields, by allowing Lilac to handle flattening and unflattening. Your map
  code will only ever see the flattened stream of fields.

Let's make a new dataset with a nested list of questions:

```python
items = [
  {'questions': ['A', 'B']},
  {'questions': ['C']},
  {'questions': ['D', 'E']},
]
dataset = ll.from_dicts('local', 'nested_questions', items)
dataset.to_pandas()
```

```
  questions
0    [A, B]
1       [C]
2    [D, E]
```

Let's do the map again, but this time we'll use `input_path=('questions', '*')` to tell Lilac to map
over each individual item in the `questions` list. This is equivalent to mapping over the flattened
list `['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']`.

```python
def add_prefix(question):
  return 'Q: ' + question

dataset.map(add_prefix, input_path=('questions', '*'), output_path='questions_prefixed')
dataset.to_pandas()
```

```
  questions questions_prefixed
0    [A, B]       [Q: A, Q: B]
1       [C]             [Q: C]
2    [D, E]       [Q: D, Q: E]
```

We can see that the `questions_prefixed` column is a nested list, with the same nestedness as the
`questions` column.

### `output_path`

To test the map function while developing without writing to a new column, we can omit the
`output_path` argument and print the result of `map`:

```python
result = dataset.map(add_prefix, input_path='question')
print(list(result))
> ['Q: B', 'Q: C', 'Q: A']
```

### Structured output

Often our maps will output multiple values for a given item, e.g. when calling GPT to extract
structure from a piece of text. If the output of the `map` function is a `dict`, Lilac will
automatically unpack the `dict` and create nested columns under the `output_path`. This is useful
when we want to output multiple values for a single input item. For example, we can use a `map`
function to compute the length of each question, and whether it ends with a question mark:

```python
items = [
  {'question': 'How are you today?'},
  {'question': 'What kind of food'},
  {'question': 'Are you sure?'},
]
dataset = ll.from_dicts('local', 'questions3', items)

def enrich(question):
  return {'length': len(question), 'ends_with_?': question[-1] == '?'}

dataset.map(enrich, input_path='question', output_path='metadata')
dataset.to_pandas()
```

```
             question  metadata.length  metadata.ends_with_?
0  How are you today?               18                  True
1   What kind of food               17                 False
2       Are you sure?               13                  True
```

If we start the Lilac web server via `ll.start_server()` and open the browser, we can see the new
column statistics in the UI and filter by their values:

### Batching

When setting the `batch_size` kwarg, map will provide your function with a list of `batch_size`
items at once. You may receive a partial batch at the end of the map, so your function should handle
receiving a batch smaller than `batch_size`.

You may also set `batch_size=-1` in order to receive the entire dataset as a single batch. This may
be useful if some computation requires seeing all rows at once - for example, a duplicate text
detector. This mode will load your entire dataset (or a column of your dataset if `input_column` is
specified) into memory, so please ensure that you have sufficient memory on your machine.

### Filtering and limiting

To run a preview computation on a few rows and sanity-check your function, run `map` with `limit=5`.

To run a computation on a subset of rows, you can pass a set of [`Filter`](#Filter)s. For example,
to limit your map to longer strings, you could run
`map(fn, filters=[Filter(path='column', op='length_greater', 20)])`. Multiple filters are combined
with `AND` - only rows matching all provided filters will be mapped.

```
items = [
    {'question': 'A', 'source': 'foo'},
    {'question': 'B', 'source': 'bar'},
    {'question': 'C', 'source': 'bar'}
]
dataset = ll.from_dicts('local', 'questions', items, overwrite=True)

result = dataset.map(
  lambda x: x['question'].lower(),
  filters=[ll.Filter(path=('source',), op='equals', value='bar')],
  limit=1)

print(list(result))
> ['b']
```

### Parallelism

By default Lilac will run the `map` on a single thread. To speed up computation, we can provide
`execution_type` and `num_jobs`. Executing type can be either `threads` or `processes`. Threads are
better for network bound tasks like making requests to an external server, while processes are
better for CPU bound tasks, like running a local LLM.

The number of jobs defaults to the number of physical cores on the machine. However, if our map
function is making requests to an external server, we can increase the number of jobs to reach the
desired number of requests per second.

```python

def compute(text_batch: list[str])-> list[str]:
  # make a single request to an external server.

dataset.map(compute, batch_size=32, input_path='question', execution_type='threads', num_jobs=10)
```

Assuming a latency of 100ms per request, we can expect to make 10 requests per second with a single
job, and 100 requests per second with 10 jobs.

### Annotations

Often our map will extract relevant information that we want to associate with the input text. For
example, when detecting company names, we want to know the location where each company name was
found. We can do this by using [](#lilac.span) annotation.

```python
import re

items = [
  {'text': 'Company name: Apple Inc.\n Apple Inc is a ...'},
  {'text': 'Google LLC is a ... Company name: Google LLC'},
  {'text': 'There is no company name here'},
]
dataset = ll.from_dicts('local', 'company', items)

def extract_company(text):
  pattern = r'Company name: (.*)?\s'
  matches = re.finditer(pattern, text)
  return [ll.span(m.span(1)[0], m.span(1)[1]) for m in matches]


dataset.map(extract_company, input_path='text', output_path='company')
dataset.to_pandas()
```

Lilac will then highlight the spans in the UI when we filter by the `company` column:

### Nested `output_path`

If we want to nest the output of a map under an existing column, we can prefix the `output_path`
with the name of the existing column: :

```python
items = [
  {'question': 'How are you today?'},
  {'question': 'What kind of food'},
  {'question': 'Are you sure?'},
]
dataset = ll.from_dicts('local', 'questions3', items)

def enrich(question):
  return {'length': len(question), 'ends_with_?': question[-1] == '?'}

dataset.map(enrich, input_path='question', output_path='question.metadata')
dataset.to_pandas()
```

```
             question  question.metadata.length  question.metadata.ends_with_?
0  How are you today?                        18                           True
1   What kind of food                        17                          False
2       Are you sure?                        13                           True
```
