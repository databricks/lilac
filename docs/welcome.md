Lilac helps you:

- **Explore** datasets with natural language (e.g. documents)
- **Enrich** your dataset with metadata (e.g. PII detection, profanity, text statistics, etc.)
- Conceptually **search** and tag your data (e.g. find paragraphs about injury)
- **Remove** unwanted or problematic data based on your own criteria
- **Analyze** patterns in your data.

Lilac runs completely **on device** using powerful open-source LLM technologies.
